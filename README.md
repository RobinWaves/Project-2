## Mass Shootings Visualizations (1982 -2021)
---
Mass shootings have a profound effect on victims and society as a whole impacting citizensâ€™ mental health, anxiety, and their perceptions of safety.  They are alarming because of the randomness of their nature and the motive is often unknown.  According to the Washington Post, 2020 was the deadliest gun violence year in decades.  So far, 2021 is worse.

The visualizations generated use data from a Mother Jones' Investigation and can be found on their website.  You can find the website and dataset [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9o6uDO18sLxBqPwl_Gh9bnhW-ev_dABH83M5Vb5L8o/edit#gid=0).  Founded in 1976, Mother Jones is a reader-supported, nonprofit investigative news organization.  The data's earliest entry is August 1982 and it was last updated on May 26, 2021.  There is a lack of consensus on how to define a mass shooting.  Mother Jones research focused on indiscriminate rampages in public places resulting in four or more victims killed by the attacker.  Excluded are shootings stemming from crimes such as armed robbery, gang violence or where perpetrators had not been identified.  Attacks where three or more victims were killed are included beginning in January 2013 due to a federal baseline mandate.  Perpetrators who died or were wounded during the attack are not included in the victim count.

Visualizations include:

    * tile layers
    * circle markers - location and victim count
    * regional boundries
* Leaflet map:
    * cluster markers
    * location of attack markers
* D3 Multi axes bar chart
    * x: Race and Age Group
    * y: Number of Incidents and Total Victims
    * Sort Ascending or Descending
